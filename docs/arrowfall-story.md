# Arrowfall: The Fractured Lands

## Overview

Arrowfall is a tower defense game with a narrative-driven campaign structure. The game features a war map aesthetic where the map itself serves as a storytelling device—revealing routes, notes, scorch marks, and warnings as players reclaim territory.

## Core Narrative Framing

- The map is the last surviving war map of the realm
- Narration is sparse, written like marginalia (e.g., "Road lost.", "Do not linger here.")
- Immersive storytelling without long cutscenes

## Regional Structure

Each region follows a consistent rhythm:
1. **Arrival** – corruption hinted
2. **Pressure** – wave defense
3. **Counteroffensive** – war mode
4. **Disruption** – capture the flag
5. **Revelation** – boss intro
6. **Boss Level** – climactic, rule-bending

## Regions

### Region I — Grasslands
- **Theme:** First corruption, denial, disbelief
- **Visual:** Green parchment stains, torn edges
- **Enemies:** Goblins, Mushrooms, Light swarms
- **Boss:** The Rootbound Colossus (fungal/wood creature)

### Region II — Volcanic Reaches
- **Theme:** Power, ambition, arrogance
- **Visual:** Burn marks, molten ink cracks
- **Enemies:** Armored enemies, Fire variants
- **Boss:** Fire Wizard (former Academy Archmage corrupted while trying to burn away corruption)

### Region III — Icy Tundra
- **Theme:** Preservation, stasis, regret
- **Visual:** Frosted parchment, faded ink
- **Enemies:** Slower, tankier enemies with shielding
- **Boss:** The Pale Sentinel (frozen guardian that must be destroyed, releasing more corruption)

### Region IV — Shadowland
- **Theme:** Truth, consequence, choice
- **Visual:** Ink bleeding through parchment
- **Enemies:** Flying Eyes, Skeletons, Mixed elite waves
- **Boss:** Dark Wizard (the Veil's Warden, twisted by centuries of containment)

## Game Modes

- **Wave Defense:** Hold positions against enemy waves
- **War Mode:** Push into enemy territory, siege objectives
- **Capture the Flag:** Recover/control strategic points

## Ending Hook

After the Dark Wizard falls, the Veil becomes unbound—setting up:
- PvP factions
- Endless mode
- Seasonal corruption shifts

## Design Philosophy

- Regions are philosophically distinct
- Bosses are ideological, not just mechanical obstacles
- Map reveal equals narrative progress
- Minimal dialogue, maximum weight
